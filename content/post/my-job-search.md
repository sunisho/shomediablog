It's coming up on 11 months since I quit my job at Anheuser Busch.

In lieu of an active job search, I spent the year <a href="/blog/post/16pounds/" target="blank">backpacking across SE Asia & Europe</a>, <a href="/blog/post/india2016/" target="blank">attending a wedding in India</a>, <a href="/blog/post/first-post-bookshelf" target="blank">rediscovering my love of reading</a>, and starting my own <a href="http://sholution.com/" target="blank">consulting business</a>.

To be clear, this consulting practice was never supposed to be a permanent solution. I wanted to lay a foundation I could lean on whenever I'm in a period of transition, now or anytime in the future.

And it worked! I was able to land a few (paid) contracts in the fall that cemented my place as an independent consultant. Here on out, I can always pick up work on the side whenever I need to.

You can check out <a href="http://sholution.com" target="blank">my website</a> to see the services I offer.

Now with my mind clear and my business established, I'm fully focused on figuring out the next step in my career.

People always ask me "What kind of job are you looking for?" - But that question is secondary to finding the right company.

**I'm solving for the who before I solve for the what.**

I had an amazing job at Anheuser Busch, leading Marketing & Sales innovation for their US portfolio. I learned a lot: from what it means to work with some of the world's largest brands to how the startup world functions, inside and out.

If I was just looking for the right job, I would have stayed at AB. But I realized I can't stay at a company long-term unless I believe in what the organization does, and I believe in how they do it.

This time around, I'm dead set on first finding a company that best fits my mold. Only then will I determine if my skillset is needed.


## The Right Company

!["Checking the Boxes"](/blog/img/check-the-box.jpg)

I do realize two very important things:

**1) There is no such thing as "perfect"**

and

**2) There is no such thing as "one and only."**

So I'm building a list of companies that come close to the ideal, realizing that there will always be a few things that aren't quite right.

My ideal company..

1. **Makes a product that I absolutely love and can get passionate about.** <BR>I'm a natural cheerleader for almost everything I get involved in. If I get into something, I get into it hard, and I try to make everyone around me get into it as well. I'd love to find that sort of passion in my day job.

2. **Is dedicated to their craft.** <BR>Whatever field the company is in, it cares deeply about making significant progress within that area.

3. **Cares deeply about the end-user experience.** <BR> I get most excited working on a product that everyday consumers will love to use.

4. **Is small enough where I can actually make an impact, and big enough where I can grow.** <BR>The potential for impact has always been important to me. I want to be able to look back on my time and say "I took the company from HERE to HERE."

These filters still create a very large umbrella of organizations: across multiple industries and geographies. In other words, I'm still fairly flexible. I do have a high preference for **consumer-facing** companies in **Boston**, **San Francisco**, and **New York**, but again, this is not hard and fast.

### What I Can Do: Product and Strategic Growth

Once I find the right company, then it's a matter of me adding real value.

I can do this in one of two areas: **Product** and **Growth**.

In my past job, I led the development and launch of several products. I also had to constantly pursue opportunities that would allow the company to pre-emptively prepare itself for the future, through innovation and strategic partnerships.

Simply put, I could add the most value within either **Product Management** or **Business Development**.

### Your Help Is Appreciated

I could use the most help in first identifying these potential companies, and then getting connected to their leadership. After reading this, if any companies pop out in your mind, let me know. The list of companies above is entirely made up of recommendations from my friends and colleagues - you're the best chance I have at making that list grow.


### Just like Finding a Parking space

!["Perfect Parking Spot"](/blog/img/parking.jpg)

Someone told me that finding a job should be like finding a parking space. Start at the place you want to get to, and work back from there. If you give up early on and park six blocks away, you would have never given yourself the chance to find that perfect, impossible space right in front of the venue. But staying camped out on the street waiting for the spot to open isn't feasible either - time is a very real obstacle. At some point you'll have to start circling around, a little farther with each new lap. But wherever you end up, you know it's the closest you could have gotten with the time you had available.

So, here I am, at the venue, looking for that perfect spot.
