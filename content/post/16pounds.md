At the end of January in 2016, I quit my job. <img style="float: right; padding:5px;" src="/blog/img/backpack.jpg" width="250"> Two months later, I hit the road with nothing but a normal backpack weighing just over 16 pounds.

The original plan, it should be stated, was nothing near what actually transpired. I was to take a break no longer than two months, and promptly find a new place of employment by the time Spring ushered Wintered out of its temporary throne.

But plans have a funny way of never coming to life in their original form.

Upon noticing that my unemployed life was almost as busy and stressful as my recently departed employed life, a good friend of mine persuaded me to block three weeks on my calendar where I would plan and do absolutely nothing. I took her advice, though I realized that the only way I'd follow through with this commitment is if I got out of the country. I had heard about SE Asia for quite some time, and thought I'd spend those three weeks exploring Vietnam, Thailand, and possibly Cambodia.

Several other great friends all pointed out that three weeks would not be enough, and serve only to keep my stress levels high and instill a long lasting regret for not having more time upon my return.

So I decided to make it six weeks, and start in April instead of March.

One thing led to another and that six weeks turned into eighteen.

I spent 11 weeks traveling through Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar.

I spent the remaining 7 weeks in Europe, seeing Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, London, and Ireland.

## What I took away

1. **This is not a once-in-a-lifetime event.** Meeting travelers from all walks of life, I realized I can do this at any point in time.
2. **I wish I spent more time in less places.** While it looks more impressive to say that I went to 11 countries, I think I would have appreciated staying put more often.
3. **What the world thinks of the US matters.** We have a tremendous impact on the world around us, and we cannot neglect the subsequent responsibility that comes with it.
