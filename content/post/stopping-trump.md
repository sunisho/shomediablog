There's been a storm of activity, both a constant bludgeoning of our core values by our sitting President, and the counter-insurgent response from We the People who do not accept his disastrous regime.

In many conversations with friends and family, I hear that lots of people want to help but are...

* <b>UNSURE</b> of where to start
* <b>OVERWHELMED</b> by everything happening, and
* <b>SKEPTICAL</b> of whether or not they can make a difference

The below is a living compilation of the resources and mental tools I use to remain engaged, effective, and optimistic.

There are lots of other groups, tools, newsletters, articles, and resources, so please send me a note / comment below if I've missed something! I'll continue to update this post.


### Start here.


# STEP 1: ENLIST.

Below are the groups I've found that keep me informed on how I can help.

* <a href="https://www.indivisibleguide.com/" target="blank">Indivisible</a> <br>A practical guide and a directory of local action groups.</a>
* <a href="https://www.womensmarch.com/100/" target="blank">Women's March 10 Actions in 100 Days</a><br>10 actions to follow the nation-wide protests.
* <a href="https://activatedmajority.tumblr.com/" target="blank">Activated Majority</a><br>From Rhize, a platform that connects people across the country with ongoing and emerging opportunities to take action and build power


# STEP 2: ACT.

<b>Commit to one thing a week.</B>

Whether that be calling your Members of Congress, attending a meeting, protesting, tweeting, writing this blogpost, or plainly having a conversation to help bridge the divide, one thing a week is something reasonable that I can take on while still feeling useful.

* <a href="http://inspiredjen.com" target="blank">Jen Hoffmann's Weekly Action Guide</a><br>This is a fantastic weekly email that Jen sends out to over 60,000 people each week. It walks you through everything you can do to act on the issues you care about. Pick one thing and do it. <br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vwydGGW9jixSsf3f7jvSuWnc67tsnI1jgIo6Homwbk/preview" target="blank">Here</a> is the latest checklist.<br><br>
* <a href="https://5calls.org" target="blank">5Calls</a><br>There is no better tool to help you call your Members of Congress. Visit the website, put in your zip code, and pick your issue. It gives you the number you need to call, the message, and moves you onto the next. You can do one of these calls each week.


# STEP 3: GET OFF SOCIAL MEDIA.

There are other ways to connect with others that want to take a stand. There are other ways to stay informed. Social Media is more detrimental than productive these days. It's depressing, and the fleeting satisfaction you get when you see someone else post your thoughts, or when you yourself are echoed by your social chamber, doesn't really help in the long run.

I use these platforms for specific reasons:

* Facebook: for activist groups that organize events & have a message boards
* Twitter: to read what my Members of Congress are thinking

But there's no use in endlessly scrolling through a newsfeed, and no use in posting something that only like-minded individuals will see.


# STEP 4: LEARN.

Below are some resources that will help you gain a foundational understanding of how to be more effective as an active citizen:

* <a href="https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resources">Indivisible Guide</a><br>How to effectively lobby your Members of Congress.
* <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beth.urie/posts/1397279370324677">Don't Email. Don't Sign Petitions.</a><br>Call. Meet In Person. More thoughts on how to effectively lobby your Members of Congress.


# STEP 5: STAY INFORMED.

Here are the list servs I'm a part of that curate the news for me, so I don't have to waste hours on end scrolling through my very demoralizing and unhealthy social medai feeds:

* <a href="https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/" target="blank">What The Fuck Just Happened Today</a> (Daily Newsletter)
* <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/votes/" target="blank">FiveThirtyEight's Congress Tracker</a>
* <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oWD2OGMhKIL6wSxKsk_gSFCJtnH2RYpCJTXxlFaLkS8/edit" target="blank">The Resistance Doctrine</a>


# STEP 6: KEEP YOUR CHIN UP.

As my friend Sergio once said:

### "That's how fascists win: they wear you down until you are too tired to fight."

Don't let that happen. What we do does make a difference. What we've done already has. And what we plan to do will change things for the better.
