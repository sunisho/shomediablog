Consider this post the official resurrection of my blog.

This is the first of many supplemental addendums to an annual email update I send to my family and friends that detail the highlights of the year that just passed.

I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (S3 and Cloudfront), and [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) to generate, publish and host my blog.

You can see my [GitHub profile](https://www.github.com/sunisho) to see my Hugo source files.

To learn Hugo and AWS, I went through a tutorial that had me build a bookshelf. I used that opportunity to feature all of the books I read in 2016.

I read more books this year than I have in the past decade (around 35), and I attribute that to two things:

1. *Unemployment*, and
2. *The Amazon Kindle*

I quit my job in January, and took the opportunity to travel. I bought a Kindle to keep my backpack light, and the combination of the free time and convenience lent to me by my new e-reader resurfaced my love for reading after being dormant for a very long time.

I read a mix of fiction and non-fiction, with an emphasis on the former, and an emphasis on Classics - mainly because I could get those out-of-copyright books for free.

This list, published on a website made by Hugo, is here:

[My 2016 Bookshelf](https://shomedia.com/blog/bookshelf/)

I'll include some of my favorite bookquotes and some of my thoughts on that website, and will continue to update it as I tackle more stories in 2017.

### *MY FAVORITES*

1. The Rivers of London Series
2. Animal Farm
3. Endurance
4. Peter and Wendy
5. The Boys in the Boat
