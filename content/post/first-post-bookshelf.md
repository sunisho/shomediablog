Consider this post the official resurrection of my blog.

I'm using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="blank">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="blank">AWS</a> (S3 and Cloudfront), and <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="blank">Namecheap</a>) to generate, publish and host my blog.

You can see my <a href="https://www.github.com/sunisho" target="blank">GitHub profile</a> to see my Hugo source files.

To get started with Hugo, Git, and AWS, I went through a tutorial that had me build a bookshelf. I used that opportunity to feature all of the books I read in 2016.


## A Reading Renaissance

I read more books this year than I have in the past decade (around 35), and I attribute that to two things:

1. **Unemployment**, and
2. **The Amazon Kindle**

I quit my job in January, and took the opportunity to travel. I bought a Kindle to keep my backpack light, and both the combination of the free time that is incumbent with travel and the convenience offered by my new e-reader resurfaced my love for reading after being dormant for a very long time.

I read a mix of fiction and non-fiction, with an emphasis on the former, and an emphasis on Classics - mainly because I could get many of those out-of-copyright books for free.

This list, published on a website also made by Hugo, is here:

I've included some of my favorite bookquotes and some of my thoughts within each book post on that website, and will continue to update it as I tackle more stories in 2017.
