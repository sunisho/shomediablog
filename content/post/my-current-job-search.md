It's coming up on 11 months since I quit my job at Anheuser Busch.

In lieu of an active job search, I spent the year <a href="/blog/post/16pounds/" target="blank">backpacking across SE Asia & Europe</a>, <a href="/blog/post/india2016/" target="blank">attending a wedding in India</a>, as well as setting up my own <a href="http://sholution.com/" target="blank">consulting business</a>.

Starting my own consulting practice was never supposed to be a permanent fix. This was just laying a foundation I could lean on as I transition now and anytime in the future. Here on out, I can always try to pick up work on the side anytime I need to. You can check out <a href="http://sholution.com" target="blank">my website</a> to see the services I offer.

But now it's high time for me to buckle down and figure out where I want to go next. A year away from the working world was well worth it, but I've missed being a part of a team working for a common purpose.

People always ask me "What kind of job are you looking for?" - But that question is secondary to finding the right company. I'm solving for the who before I solve for the what.

I had an amazing job at Anheuser Busch, leading Marketing & Sales innovation for their US portfolio. I learned a lot: from what it means to work with some of the world's largest brands to how the startup world functions, inside and out.

If I was just looking for the right job, I would have stayed at AB. But I found out the hard way that I can't be successful at a company long-term unless I believe in what the organization does, and I believe in how they do it.

This time around, I'm dead set on first finding a company that best fits my mold. Only then will I worry about if they have real need for my set of skills.


## The Right Company

!["Checking the Boxes"](/blog/img/check-the-box.jpg)

I do realize two very important things: 1) there is no such thing as "perfect" and 2) there is no such thing as "one and only." So I'm building a list of companies that come close to the ideal, realizing that there will always be a few things that aren't quite right.

I'm looking for several traits in a company:

1. **They make a product that I absolutely love and can get passionate about.** <BR>I'm a natural cheerleader for almost everything I get involved in. If I get into something, I get into it hard, and I try to make everyone around me get into it as well. I'd love to find that sort of passion in my day job.

2. **They are dedicated to their craft.** <BR>Whatever field the company is in, it cares deeply about making significant progress within that area.

3. **They care deeply about the end-user experience.** <BR> I get most excited working on a product that everyday consumers will love to use.

4. **They are small enough where I can actually make an impact, and big enough where I can grow.** <BR>The potential for impact has always been important to me. I want to be able to look back on my time and say "I took the company from HERE to HERE."

These parameters still refer to a very large umbrella of organizations.

I'm not focusing on any particular industry, though again I do have a preference for something consumer-facing.

And I'm fairly location agnostic, with a high preference for **Boston**, **San Francisco**, and **New York**. I'd also consider other places, like Chicago and Seattle, but I think I'd be best off if I found a job in one of those first three.

### What I Can Do: Product and Strategic Growth

Once I find the right company, then it's a matter of me adding real value.

I can do this in one of two areas: **Product** and **Growth**.

In my past job, I led the development and launch of several products. I also had to constantly pursue opportunities that would allow the company to pre-emptively prepare itself for the future, through innovation and strategic partnerships.

Simply put, I could add the most value within either **Product Management** or **Business Development**.


### Just like Finding a Parking space

!["Perfect Parking Spot"](/blog/img/parking.jpg)

Someone told me that finding a job should be like finding a parking space. Start at the place you want to get to, and work back from there. If you give up early on and park six blocks away, you would have never given yourself the chance to find that perfect, impossible space right in front of the venue. But staying camped out on the street waiting for the spot to open isn't feasible either. At some point you'll have to start circling around, a little farther with each new lap. But wherever you end up, you know it's the closest you could have gotten with the time you had available.

So, here I am, at the venue, looking for that perfect spot.
